# Les positions : 

**position: static**
Default value. Elements render in order, as they appear in the document flow.

**position: relative**
The element is positioned relative to its normal position, so "left:20px" adds 20 pixels to the element's LEFT position

**position: absolute**
The element is positioned relative to its first positioned (not static) ancestor element

**position: fixed**
The element is positioned relative to the browser window

**position: sticky**
The element is positioned based on the user's scroll position
A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).

**position: initial**
Sets this property to its default value.

**position: inherit**
Inherits this property from its parent element.
